North of Virden

Westman Naturalists - Autumn Hawk Watch

Come join us for our annual Autumn Hawk Watch at a beautiful spot on the Assiniboine River Valley north of Virden. We should see a variety of raptors flying south, with close views if the wind is in the right direction; plus ducks, geese, cranes and a surprising number of Blue Jays and American Robins.

We will have telescopes and binoculars available, but please bring yours if you have them, as well as a camera, lawn-chair, water and snacks or lunch.

The hawk watch runs until about noon. If there is interest we may make a side-trip to Oak Lake on our way back to Brandon.

Delta Beach & Portage Plains

Westman Naturalists - Birding & Exploring

Cal Cuthbert will guide us to find all that this great area north of Portage offers. This should be an excellent outing as Cal is an expert birder and guide and knows the area very well. We can expect to see many migrating birds!

We will be driving to various spots in the area with short walks, mostly on trails, but some on the beach.

Please dress for all possible weather, and bring a lunch. Don't forget your binoculars, camera and telescope if you have them. Some car pooling from Brandon will be available, Delta Beach is about 1.5hrs away.
