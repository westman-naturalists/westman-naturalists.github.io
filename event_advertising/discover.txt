Westman Naturalists - Spruce Woods History

Take a tour with us along the edge of Spruce Woods Provincial Forest as we learn some history on the area from a local, Heather Dalgleish. Along the dirt road to the forest there are many bird boxes and a variety of wildflower species. After visiting the forest, we’ll drive up to the interpretive site south of the Douglas Marsh to hear more history and information on watershed management.

The dirt road is a bit rough and uneven, depending on the clearance of your vehicle we may need to switch around and carpool. We’ll be walking 2-3km on a sandy track, so be sure to bring proper footwear.
