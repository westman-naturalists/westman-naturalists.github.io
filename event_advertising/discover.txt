Westman Naturalists - Autumn Hawk Watch

Come join us for our annual Autumn Hawk Watch at a beautiful spot on the Assiniboine River Valley north of Virden. We should see a variety of raptors flying south, with close views if the wind is in the right direction; plus ducks, geese, cranes and a surprising number of Blue Jays and American Robins.

We will have telescopes and binoculars available, but please bring yours if you have them, as well as a camera, lawn-chair, water and snacks or lunch.

The hawk watch runs until about noon. If there is interest we may make a side-trip to Oak Lake on our way back to Brandon.
