Westman Naturalists - Rivers Christmas Bird Count

This is a chance to take part in a North America wide count of birds in winter. Either by watching your feeder or getting out to search for birds within a circle around Rivers.

There are two ways to participate in a Christmas Bird Count. You can join a group as a field counter within an assigned area, or be a feeder watcher and count the birds that come to your yard and feeders. Everyone is welcome to join the count regardless of skill level, beginner birders will be partnered with more experienced birders, and identification help will be available. Participants can join for a full day of counting or the amount of time that best suits them.

You will receive an email and/or phone call from one of our coordinators to confirm details about your participation, and give you full instructions.

**Participation**: Please complete this [short form](https://forms.gle/KMr3Z45hXZbB58RF9) to sign-up for this event. We will email you with specific details a day or so before the event. Car pooling might be available.
