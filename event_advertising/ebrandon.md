Westman Naturalists - Sharing Stories and Photos

Join Westman Naturalists for a night of sharing nature photos and stories! This will be our third time hosting this event where we invite members to share their photos and the story behind them. It's a great opportunity to hear about the interesting adventures and fascinating things other members have done or seen.

We'll have a form for submitting photos closer to the date of the event, but you can find the meeting information (and reminder form) below if you're interested in seeing what everyone else shares.

Everyone will be able to share up to four stories with photos within four minutes. The photos don't have to be taken in Manitoba! Our hope is to have a good mix of in-person and online members, so if you normally join via Zoom, don’t feel like you can’t participate!

This is a hybrid event! Feel free to come in person to meet us all and see the talk, or join us via Zoom.

See [our website](https://westman-naturalists.github.io/events.html#2025-12-11-1) to sign up for a reminder or for the Zoom details.

Westman Naturalists - Wahtopanah Waterfowl Wander

We'll be wandering (driving) around Lake Wahtopanah by Rivers on the lookout for interesting ducks that may be migrating through. Specifically scoter, but we haven't found one on the last two outings so I don't want to jinx it. There will be plenty of other species to see!

We'll have spotting scopes to share, but be sure to bring your own (if you have one) and binoculars. We will drive to various spots around the lake. There will probably be some walking in rough areas and along the beach, so please wear good boots. Don't forget to bring water and snacks.

**Participation**: Please complete this short form (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe74mImVd9S6GaHS_N7pFa0dE8U0aI1soyXGA1iRvVqjZ8CGQ/viewform) to sign-up for this event. We will email you with specific details a day or so before the event. Car pooling might be available.

Westman Naturalists - October Big Day

October Big Day is coming up this Saturday, and once again we're taking a walk at the Riverbank Discovery Centre to look for and count all the migrating birds we can find! After the walk, anyone interested can join us as we drive over to the Griswold Marsh where we should find a variety of waterfowl.

October Big Day is an event that encourages experts and amateurs to count birds all across the world.
