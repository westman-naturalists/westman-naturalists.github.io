Baldur Area

Westman Naturalists - Birding & Exploring

Join us on a trip to explore the area near Baldur, south of Glenboro. Last year we found more than 50 bird species and a very nice coyote! At this time of year we should see a variety of waterfowl, sparrows, and lots of other migrating birds.

The area is about 1hr 10m away from Brandon, so we'll meet in Brandon once it is light, for anyone who wants to carpool. Dress for the weather, this is October... and consider bringing a lunch!

Once we are in the target area, most of the roads are gravel. Most of the nature watching will be from or beside the car. Don't forget your binoculars, camera and telescope if you have them. We will have extra telescopes available.

**Participation**: Please complete this short form (https://forms.gle/DAVCbPZ6fXmxRQ5q8) to sign-up for this event. We will email you with specific details a day or so before the event. Car pooling might be available.

Whitewater Lake

Westman Naturalists - Birding Adventure

Join us on a trip to explore the area around Whitewater Lake, west of Boissevain. We should see a variety of birds species, including, ducks, cranes, shorebirds and other migrants at this world-class birding destination. As well a a mammal or two if we are lucky.

The lake is 20km long and 8km wide with relatively few roads going to the shore, so our adventure will be mostly by car (we will stay in one group), stopping at various locations, and going for some short walks. Some walking will be easy, some (optional) walking may be very rough along sloping ground with gopher holes. Please wear appropriate footwear and clothing, and be ready for all weathers.

Please bring water, snacks and lunch. Don't forget your binoculars, camera and telescope if you have them, bird ID apps (Merlin, Warbler Guide, Sibley, IBird, etc.) and a bird book might be useful. We will have extra telescopes available.
