Baldur Area

Westman Naturalists - Birding & Exploring

Join us on a trip to explore the area near Baldur, south of Glenboro. Last year we found more than 50 bird species and a very nice coyote! At this time of year we should see a variety of waterfowl, sparrows, and lots of other migrating birds.

The area is about 1hr 10m away from Brandon, so we'll meet in Brandon once it is light, for anyone who wants to carpool. Dress for the weather, this is October... and consider bringing a lunch!

Once we are in the target area, most of the roads are gravel. Most of the nature watching will be from or beside the car. Don't forget your binoculars, camera and telescope if you have them. We will have extra telescopes available.

Whitewater Lake

Westman Naturalists - Birding Adventure

Join us on a trip to explore the area around Whitewater Lake, west of Boissevain. We should see a variety of birds species, including, ducks, cranes, shorebirds and other migrants at this world-class birding destination. As well a a mammal or two if we are lucky.

The lake is 20km long and 8km wide with relatively few roads going to the shore, so our adventure will be mostly by car (we will stay in one group), stopping at various locations, and going for some short walks. Some walking will be easy, some (optional) walking may be very rough along sloping ground with gopher holes. Please wear appropriate footwear and clothing, and be ready for all weathers.

Please bring water, snacks and lunch. Don't forget your binoculars, camera and telescope if you have them, bird ID apps (Merlin, Warbler Guide, Sibley, IBird, etc.) and a bird book might be useful. We will have extra telescopes available.

Westman Naturalists - Cattle Ranch & Wooded Valley

Come join us at a working cattle ranch, with pasture, wooded valley and a cabin with lovely views. We will enjoy the fall weather and scenery, hopefully with the addition of a few migrating birds. We will build a fire and have a wiener roast at the cabin, hot dogs and buns will be provided but please bring any other food you'd like and your own water!

The walk to the cabin is about 1km return on groomed trails with a few ups and downs. There will be more options to walk the trails for those who would like to go out a little further. Please wear appropriate footwear, and be ready for all weather at this time of year.

We will have telescopes and binoculars available, but please bring yours if you have them, as well as a camera and a lawn-chair. A side-by-side will be available to transport lawn chairs to the cabin.
