Sandhill Exploration

Come join us and explore a wild property to the south of Oak Lake. We will go through the property on mowed trails going through and past sandhills, meadows, woodlands, and marshes. We'll see various native flowers including gentians and cacti, bees and butterflies, and birds, hopefully including Lark Sparrow and Veery.

This outing involves walking along trails that will have Poison Ivy and roots or branches to trip on. Please be prepared, you will need to bring a good pair of walking shoes, sunscreen, bug protection, water, snacks and lunch. The walk is planned to be between 2.5-3.5km.

Participation: Please complete this short form (https://forms.gle/4FaExDQUy2bSvN6G6) to sign-up for this event. We will email you with specific details a day or so before the event. Car pooling might be available.

Nature Walk at Dead End Swamp

Take a walk with us along the Assiniboine River and a golf course at the [north end of 50th St](https://maps.app.goo.gl/KwzgyVTP9Y7ziPLm7) in Brandon. The marshy water on the east side of the trail was part of the river until it changed course. Parking space past the tracks is a bit limited, so be mindful when coming down the hill.

The loop around the water is about 2km and the trail may be a bit rough, so be sure to bring proper footwear.

Participation: No sign up is required for this event, though there will be a waiver to sign.

Midsummer Dragonflies

Join Westman Naturalists and Bill Gallaway for an outing all about dragonflies! The different groups of dragonflies (such as darners, whitefaces, and meadowhawks) will be discussed, with some reference papers printed out. We'll go through a list of what species you can expect to find in southwestern Manitoba and with luck we'll come across some of them!

The exact location is yet to be determined, but we're aiming for somewhere within an hour of Brandon.

Participation: Please complete this short form (https://forms.gle/Gsx8eE4tZNRuXY7KA) to sign-up for this event. We will email you with specific details a day or so before the event. Car pooling might be available.
