Sharing Stories and Photos

Join Westman Naturalists for a night of sharing nature photos and stories! This will be our third time hosting this event where we invite members to share their photos and the story behind them. It's a great opportunity to hear about the interesting adventures and fascinating things other members have done or seen.

We'll have a form for submitting photos closer to the date of the event, but you can find the meeting information (and reminder form) below if you're interested in seeing what everyone else shares.

Everyone will be able to share up to four stories with photos within four minutes. The photos don't have to be taken in Manitoba! Our hope is to have a good mix of in-person and online members, so if you normally join via Zoom, don’t feel like you can’t participate!

This is a hybrid event! Feel free to come in person to meet us all and see the talk, or join us via Zoom.

See our website (https://westman-naturalists.github.io/events.html#2025-12-11-1) to sign up for a reminder or for the Zoom details.

Brodie Building Rm 4-34, Brandon University (directions: https://westman-naturalists.github.io/talks.html)
