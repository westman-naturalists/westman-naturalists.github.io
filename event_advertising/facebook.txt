Factors controlling distribution and abundance of mosses in a natural spring

We're excited to have Emily Tesarski, a science student at Brandon University, share results from her local study on mosses. Mosses are non-vascular plants that require specific conditions (including access to water) to successfully establish. Waggle Springs Fen is a natural spring site near Brandon, Manitoba that contains mosses Tomentypnum nitens, Drepanocladus aduncus, and Aulacomnium palustre. This study aims to investigate the relationship between these mosses and factors such as elevation and shrub presence. It also aims to quantify the moss presence, and identify additional moss species in Waggle Springs Fen.

**We're also excited to announce that Emily's supervisor, Dr. McGonigle, has offered bring moss samples and microscopes so that after the talk and some questions, everyone can have a closer look!**

A bit about Emily Tesarski: I am in my final year of my undergraduate science degree at Brandon University. I have always loved plants but have only recently began to study them more in depth. I enjoy school, and I work two jobs outside of my classes. In my rare free time, I love to garden, paint, read, expand my shoe and lip-gloss collections, and hang out with my cat Alec.

This is a hybrid event! Feel free to come in person to meet the speaker and see the talk, or join us via Zoom.
