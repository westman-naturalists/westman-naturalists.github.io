<p>Take a tour with us along the edge of Spruce Woods Provincial Forest as we learn some history on the area from a local, Heather Dalgleish.

<p>We’ll be heading to a plot of land by Griswold Marsh this Sunday for a variety of wildflowers in bloom, including blazing star, lousewort, and clover. We also hope to see lots of insects and grassland birds! Some plants have been blooming in an unexpected order this year, but it is still a great time of year to go looking for them.</p>
<p>This is a morning trip with vehicle access to the area and short walks over flat terrain. There are roadside ditches to cross in some areas. Please wear appropriate clothing and footwear and bring water and snacks/lunch. Don’t forget insect repellent as both ticks and mosquitoes may be present.</p>

<p><span class="event-title">Red-headed Woodpecker Blitz</span> Hosted by Manitoba IBA Program</p>
<p>Register by July 2nd! This is a Manitoba Important Bird Areas Program event.</p>
<p>The Manitoba IBA Program is looking for volunteers for their upcoming Red-headed Woodpecker blitz around Oak Lake!</p>
<p>Prior to the blitz (once registration has closed), volunteers will be split up into groups and each group will be assigned an area to cover. Each group can then decide on a meeting spot for Saturday morning. Groups will spend the morning in their respective areas looking for Red-headed Woodpeckers. It is recommended that groups aim to begin birding by 8:30am. The blitz will end with everyone meeting up for a group lunch around 12:30pm. The lunch location and other info (including group details) will be sent out closer to the event via email to registered participants.</p>

<p><span class="event-title">Flowers and Sandhills</span> Hosted by Westman Naturalists</p>
<p>Join us for a trip to an MHHC property near Lauder to check out a remarkable natural habitat in western Manitoba. We will find the rare Western Spiderwort, hopefully in flower, as well as Hairy Prairie-clover, Spinystar cacti, and other interesting plants. There will also be a chance to see Lark Sparrows, Eastern Towhees, various insects and Smooth Green Snakes!</p>
<p>This will be a morning outing, we will leave Brandon at 7am. There will be an option to explore the surrounding area following our visit to the sandhills.</p>
<p>The area is some distance from Brandon, about 1 1/4 hour drive. There are moderately steep sandhills in the area to climb or you can keep to the flatter, generally sandy, terrain. There will be 2-3km of walking. Please wear appropriate clothing and footwear and bring water and snacks/lunch. Don’t forget insect repellent as the usual ticks and mosquitoes may be joined by sand flies or black flies. There is also Poison Ivy at this site!</p>

<p><span class="event-title">Mixed-grass Prairie IBA Blitz</span> Hosted by Manitoba IBA Program</p>
<p>Register by June 4th! This is a Manitoba IBA Program event.</p>
<p>The Manitoba IBA Program is looking for volunteers to help count grassland birds in the Southwestern Manitoba Mixed-Grass Prairie IBA on Saturday, June 7th. We hope to find bird species at risk such as the Chestnut-collared Longspur, Sprague’s Pipit, Ferruginous Hawk, Loggerhead Shrike and more!</p>
<p>Before the event (once registration has closed), we will split volunteers up into groups and each group will be assigned an area to cover. Each group can then decide on a meeting spot for Saturday morning. Each group will spend the morning in their respective areas looking for grassland bird species at risk. We recommend that groups aim to begin birding by 5:30am. We will all meet up in Melita around noon to finish off with a group lunch (paid for by the IBA Program). More details will be sent out to registered participants.</p>
<p><strong>Registration required!</strong> The deadline to register is Wednesday, June 4th (so that groups and group maps can be finalized before the event). For more information and to sign up, visit the <a href="ttps://forms.gle/a6YPxLn9SD6L9vss8">MB IBA Program form</a>, or their website at <a href="https://importantbirdareasmb.ca/">https://importantbirdareasmb.ca/</a>.

<p>Come join Jackie Dixon to learn more about the waterfowl that join us for the summer and migrate through Westman in spring and fall. Jackie knows her ducks incredibly well and will share some of her tips and tricks with us, so we can get closer to identifying the ducks we see. We will have telescopes available and no doubt will see other birds, animals, insects and flora on this outing.</p>
<p>The location is to be determined, but we will aim for a location within about half an hour of Brandon, with good views of a variety of ducks. We may have to drive a bit to find different habitats. This morning outing may involve some walking, so be prepared with appropriate boots and clothing.</p>

<p><span class="event-title">The Biology and Disease Burden of Ticks in Manitoba</span> Hosted by Westman Naturalists</p>
<p>Ticks are the most important vectors of human diseases in Manitoba, with two endemic species responsible for most of the public health burden: Black-legged (Deer) Ticks and American Dog (Wood) Ticks. This presentation will cover aspects of their biology, including their life cycle, unique sensory organs, and feeding behaviours. The different diseases caused by these tick species, as well as emerging diseases and invasive species to the province will be detailed. Finally, tick bite prevention and treatment options will be discussed.</p>
<p>Bryan Cassone is a professor in the Department of Biology at Brandon University. He earned a BSc at Western University, MSc at University of Guelph, and PhD at University of Notre Dame. His research bridges entomology and pathology, with interests in tick and mosquito disease transmission, plastic biodegradation, and disease diagnostic development.</p>

<p><span class="event-title">Nature Walk</span> Hosted by Westman Naturalists</p>
<p>The sun should be setting late enough now to give us enough time to enjoy an evening walk in Brandon! Join us for a start-of-spring walk at the Assiniboine Food Forest, right in the middle of maple syrup season.</p>
<p>We’ll meet at the parking lot of <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/NX7URB3XxzmoZyJx8">Crow’s General Store</a>. The walk will be about 2km, and the trail may be muddy, snowy, or both. Dress for the weather!</p>

<p><span class="event-title">Spring Hawk Watch</span> Hosted by Westman Naturalists</p>
<p>Hawks have started to migrate north! Come and count them with us as they pass by a view point overlooking the Assiniboine Valley north of Virden. We host a regular hawk watch in September and wanted to expand our efforts this year! Data from this count is added to data gathered across the continent to monitor raptor populations and migration.</p>
<p>Don’t worry if your hawk ID skills need work, there will be plenty of “experts” there to help. Please bring a lawn chair if you have one, we are at one spot for a few hours. Also snacks, coffee, etc. and of course binoculars, camera and a scope if you have one. We expect to be watching hawks until just after lunch or thereabouts.</p>

<p><span class="event-title">Migration Monitoring Through Bird Banding</span> Hosted by Westman Naturalists</p>
<p>Paula Grieef is the Resident Naturalist at the Harry J. Enns Wetland Discovery Centre at Oak Hammock Marsh. As a part of her broad scope of work she coordinates wildlife and bird surveys, including starting the Delta Marsh Bird Observatory in 1995. Bird banding contributes to our understanding of populations and patterns in migratory and resident birds. This research is even more important in the face of a rapidly changing climate. Paula will share stories of bird research, the hows and whys and some of the trends for common species caught.</p>
<p>Paula has been birding all her life. She doesn’t remember a time when she couldn’t identify at least some birds. She has lived in Manitoba all her life and loves to travel, birding wherever she goes. She completed her Master of Science from the University of Manitoba on cowbirds at Delta Marsh. In addition to her work the Oak Hammock Marsh, Paula coordinates the Manitoba Breeding Bird Atlas and sits on committees for the Manitoba Important Bird Area Program, the Bluebird Fund, and the Manitoba Ornithological Records.</p>

<p>Participatory sciences encompass citizen science, community science, volunteer monitoring and many other ways in which scientists and the general public work together to perform research. Westman Naturalists often contribute to these kinds of projects but we don’t always know how the data we collect are ultimately used to help researchers. In this talk Steffi will introduce you to participatory science and highlight some projects in the natural sciences. We’ll explore how they work and take a look at the interesting research they’ve led to.</p>
<p>Steffi LaZerte is an R programmer and biological consultant with a background in ornithology, particularly behavioural ecology. Many of Steffi’s professional projects involved working with data collected through participatory science and she has seen first hand the variety and quantity of such projects.</p>

You can share up to four stories with photos within four minutes. Our hope is to have a good mix of in-person and online members, so if you normally join via Zoom, don’t feel like you can’t participate! We will put everything together and handle the technology, all you have to do is show up!</p>
<p>While we really encourage you to describe your own photos, we understand that not everyone feels comfortable doing so, or can make it to the event. So you can indicate whether you would like to submit a short blurb or description and have someone else read it for you.</p>

<p>Last year we hosted a pop up outing to search for scoters by Rivers, and this year we’re going again! While seeing a Black or White-winged Scoter is our goal, there will be plenty of other species to see.</p>
<p>We’ll have spotting scopes to share and a duck expert to assist with identifications! Bring your scope, binoculars and camera if you have them. We will drive to various spots around the lake. There will probably be some walking in rough areas and along the beach, so please wear good boots. Don’t forget to bring water and snacks.</p>

<p>A few Westman Naturalists members have been touring around Grund/Baldur south of Glenboro, and they’ve found more than 50 bird species and a very nice coyote! Join us for a tour along the grid roads that will take us past a few different habitats. At this time of year we should see a variety of waterfowl, sparrows, and lots of other migrating birds.</p>
<p>The area is about 1hr 10m away from Brandon, so we’ll meet in Brandon once it is light, for anyone who wants to carpool. Dress for the weather and consider bringing a lunch! Once we are in the target area, most of the roads are gravel. Most of the nature watching will be from inside or beside a car.</p>

<p><span class="event-title">Hawk Watch</span> Hosted by Westman Naturalists</p>
<p>Come and count hawks as they migrate South on Sunday morning. The view point is a marvellous spot overlooking the Assiniboine Valley, North of Virden.</p>
<p>Our hawk watch is a regular, yearly event and is part of a North America wide effort to count migrating raptors. We usually see numerous birds floating by as they head South.</p>
<p>Don’t worry if your hawk ID skills need work, there will be plenty of “experts” there to help. They usually learnt at past hawk watches :) Please bring a LAWN CHAIR if you have one - we are at one spot for a few hours. Also snacks, coffee, etc. AND of course binoculars, camera and a scope if you have one. Bring your bird book too, if you have one! There is a free app which may be useful - Raptor ID.</p>
<p>Hawk-watching will probably last until just after lunch or thereabouts. After the watch you can go home, or join us in taking a detour to see what Oak Lake has to offer in the way of birds.</p>
<p><strong>Trip difficulty</strong>: Minimal walking involved, but the surface is rough in places.</p>

<p>Come join Jackie Dixon to learn more about the waterfowl that join us for the summer and migrate through Westman in spring and fall. Jackie really knows her ducks and will share some of her tips and tricks with us, so we can get closer to ID’ing the ducks we see - even in the fall!!! We will have telescopes available and no doubt will see other birds, animals, insects and flora on this outing.</p>
<p>The location is to be determined, but we will aim for a location within about half an hour of Brandon, with good views of a variety of ducks. We may have to drive a bit to find different habitats. This morning outing may involve some walking, so be prepared with appropriate boots and clothing,</p>

The exact location will be determined on the day, depending on conditions and scouting.</p>
<p>We will snowshoe as a group at a fairly slow pace, through trails and bush for a distance of up to 4km. After our snowshoeing adventure we will drive a few roads to see what other tracks and wildlife we can find.</p>
<p>If you are travelling from Brandon we will leave town around 9am and meet up again in Wasagaming at about 10:15am. We will probably finish our day at the Park between 2 and 3pm. Car pooling will be available. This event is in the National Park so please be prepared to purchase a pass at the gate if you bring a vehicle; the cost is ~$8.50/person or $16.75/vehicle.</p>

<p>Quetico Provincial Park, located in northwestern Ontario, is a world famous destination for backcountry canoeing with over 2,000 lakes and 460,000 ha of remote wilderness. Please join Westman Naturalist members, Steffi and Alex, as they share logistics, photos, and stories of their recent 125km, 7-day, canoe adventure through this fantastic landscape. They saw a range of plants and animals (and some fun behaviours!) from regenerating forests, towering white pines, curious beavers, a loud asylum of loons, and a family of majestic trumpeter swans. Their canoe route took them through large and small lakes, rivers, swamps, across <em>many</em> beaver dams, past granite bluffs, and they even camped on an island just barely big enough for a tent! In this talk, Steffi and Alex will unpack some of the interesting animal behaviour observations, ecology, and natural history of the area, as well as some of the logistics and planning they did for this adventure.</p>

<p><strong>Glacial Lake Agassiz</strong>: During the Wisconsin glacial period, 75,000 to 10,000 years ago, the Laurentide Ice Sheet covered much of North America. As the ice sheet began to melt the massive Lake Agassiz formed in front of the ice sheet as it retreated northward. A total, 950,000 km2 was covered at some point time by Lake Agassiz water. Lake Winnipeg, Cedar Lake, Lake Manitoba, and Lake Winnipegosis are all that remains of this once massive lake. Just like modern lakes, wave action formed beaches at the shores of Lake Agassiz. Along the Manitoba Escarpment we can spot some of these old beaches as low and linear ridges comprised of sand and gravel.</p>

<p>Exploring nature and history at the lake.</p>
<p>Lake Clementi, a small lake in the Brandon Hills, is a favoured spot for local birders. In June, the forests around the lake are full of Baltimore Orioles, Blue Jays, Cedar Waxwings, and many other songbirds that fill the air with song. The lake also offers excellent opportunities to see ducks, grebes, and cormorants.</p>
<p>But few are aware of the rich human history of Lake Clementi. It was a popular vacation and picnicking spot for Brandon Citizens beginning in the late 1880s. Interest in the area declined when the road was built north to Clear Lake and plans to build a large resort with many cottages were abandoned.</p>
<p>Join the Westman Naturalists for a morning stroll along Lake Clementi on Sunday, June 4 to enjoy the abundant natural life in this beautiful spot. We will also take a stroll into the past with a presentation on Lake Clementi history from a long-time resident at the lake.</p>
<p>Depending on time and birds seen, we might investigate other locations in the Brandon Hills. Bring your apps, bird and plant books, binoculars, cameras, etc. Don’t forget to wear appropriate clothing and footwear. A spotting scope will be available to view birds on the lake.</p>
<p>Trip Leaders: Glennis Lewis and Gillian Richards</p>

<p>Can birds use smell to communicate and to evaluate potential mates? In this talk, Dr.&nbsp;Grieves will give a brief background on the possible origins of the myth that birds do not smell. Next, they will demonstrate the kinds of information that are available in bird body odour, using the humble Song Sparrow as a model. Finally, Leanne will share the results of some of their behavioural experiments performed to test whether birds use odour to make choices about the kinds of birds they want to hang around—and potentially mate—with.</p>
<p>Dr.&nbsp;Leanne Grieves (pronouns: they/them or she/her) is a biologist specializing in animal behaviour and communication. Originally from Manitoba, Leanne is currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at McMaster University, focusing on understanding the factors that affect bird body odour and how smell affects birds’ social and reproductive behaviour.</p>

<p>Come and join Dr.&nbsp;Alex Koiter on a nature walk through the Souris River Bend Wildlife Management Area and learn about the natural history of this region. In addition to leaning about the physical landscape, we will have the opportunity to walk through both woodlands and prairie where we can hope to see a range of plant and animal species.</p>
<p>Trip details: We will meet at the trailhead at 10am on Sunday July 31st. It is approximately a 40 min drive from Brandon and the last 15km of driving is on gravel roads. Directions to the trailhead can be found here: https://goo.gl/maps/bMEdUpirotdTLVdf6. There is no parking lot so please use caution when parking along the side of the road.</p>
<p><strong>Trip difficulty</strong>: This outing involves walking along a well established, but uneven, trail. A good pair of walking shoes, sunscreen, bug protection, water, and a snack are strongly recommended. The walk will be approximately 3hrs in duration and 4km in length.</p>
<p><strong>To register please fill out our <a href="https://forms.gle/VdLvEMVSjzcJEgWYA">online form</a> by 5pm Saturday July 30th (the day before)</strong></p>
<p>We will email out a confirmation on Saturday evening, and let you know of any changes due to weather etc.</p>
<p><strong>What is River Piracy?</strong> River piracy, also known as river capture, is an event where a river is diverted from its original channel into a neighbouring river. There are lots of different processes that can result in river piracy including erosion, damming by glacial ice or landslides, glacial retreat, or tectonic movement. The Souris River begins in Saskatchewan and flows southeast into south North Dakota and loops back into Manitoba. Approximately 20 km southeast of Wawanesa the Souris River takes a sharp 90 degree turn and joins the Assiniboine River east of Brandon. It wasn’t always like this as the Souris used to continue to flow southeast in the Pembina Valley back into North Dakota. What changed the course of the Souris River? A tributary of the Assiniboine River eroded a channel through the Tiger Hills moraine and “captured” the Souris River and diverted the water into the Assiniboine River abandoning its original channel.</p>

<p>Lake Clementi, a small lake in the Brandon Hills, is alive with bird song any morning in June. But now, with the leaves on the trees, it is a real test of any birder’s ability to identify what those birds are. So how can the Merlin app help? Join the Westman Naturalists for a stroll along Lake Clementi on Sunday, June 12, to try out your skills at bird song identification. If you haven’t used the Merlin app before, this is your chance to give it a try (or just rely on your ears and eyes to tell you what birds are singing). We’ll also show how iNaturalist or Seek can be used to help identify any other plants, insects or animals we encounter.</p>
<p>Depending on time and birds seen, we might investigate other locations in the Brandon Hills. Bring your apps, bird and plant books, binoculars, cameras, etc. Don’t forget to wear appropriate clothing and footwear. A spotting scope may come in handy as there are often birds on the lake.</p>

<p>The Parulidae family (Wood-warblers) are a group of small, fast moving, and often very colourful birds. Over 20 species regularly occur in Manitoba, many of which have distinct male and female plumages that change over the course of the year. This makes them challenging to identify, even for seasoned birders. Christian Artuso will present on the warblers found in Manitoba, and provide tips and tricks for how to identify them.</p>
<p>Many will know Christian for his major contributions to birding and conservation in Manitoba, including coordinating the Manitoba Breeding Bird Atlas. Christian now works as a biologist for the Migratory Bird Conservation Unit of Environment and Climate Change Canada, in Ottawa.</p>

<p><a href="http://lishaberzins.ca/">Dr.&nbsp;Lisha Berzins</a> joins us to discuss aerial insectivores and prairie wetland conservation!</p>
<p>Aerial insectivores (swallows, swifts, nightjars, and flycatchers) are steeply declining in parts of their range and one potential driver of these declines is agricultural intensification. Tree swallows feed primarily on insects that emerge from aquatic habitats and so the loss or drainage of wetlands associated with agricultural intensification may impact tree swallows through their insect food supply. In this talk, Dr.&nbsp;Berzins will use long-term data (&gt;28 years from the St.&nbsp;Denis National Wildlife Area) and field experiments to demonstrate how prairie wetlands influence the ability of tree swallows to breed successfully and produce high-quality young with greater survival prospects, and reduce aquatic insect food available to them. Ultimately, she will discuss whether retaining wetlands in agricultural cropland can offset the negative effect of agricultural intensification on tree swallows, and likely other ecologically similar species.</p>

<p>We are all a little rusty at bird identification when spring migration starts. Hopefully, after listening to bird song recordings and studying field guides, we are soon back at our peak skills in naming the new arrivals. But, let’s face it, some birds are just flat out difficult to identify at any time.</p>
<p>The Westman Naturalists are pleased to offer a workshop with Dr.&nbsp;Christian Artuso, (one of our favourite bird experts) where all your burning questions about difficult spring and summer birds will be answered. Want to know if that was a Golden or juvenile Bald Eagle you just saw? House or purple finch? Christian can give you some tips to make identification easier. Is that an Eastern or Western Meadowlark singing on the fence post? Christian can help you differentiate between the two.</p>
<p>To be sure to get your questions answered, please email your questions about bird identification to us at <a href="mailto:westman.naturalists@gmail.com">westman.naturalists@gmail.com</a> by Monday May 3rd. We will forward the questions to Christian, and he will answer them in our Webinar on May 7th.</p>
<p>This workshop will be interactive… a chance to learn from Christian for all birders, expert and beginner. And remember, every question is a good question.</p>

<p><span class="event-title">Wild Turkeys: A Year in the Life</span> Hosted by Westman Naturalists</p>
<p>Wild turkeys are a common sight in many Ontario landscapes. However, this was not always the case. Turkeys were hunted to extinction in Ontario in the early 1900s and were only reintroduced to the province in the 1980s when wildlife managers traded moose, otter and grouse for turkeys from several US states. Since their reintroduction, Ontario’s wild turkey population has grown rapidly.</p>
<p>Unlike migratory bird species, turkeys stay in Ontario year-round with their behaviour and sociality changing with the seasons. Jenn Baici, a PhD candidate at Trent University, will be discussing the history of wild turkeys in Ontario, how turkey behaviour changes throughout the year, and what this means for her research. She welcomes any and all turkey questions. You can visit <a href="http://www.jennbaici.weebly.com">www.jennbaici.weebly.com</a> to learn more about research projects she has been involved with.</p>

<p>If you live in or close to Brandon (within 7.5miles of 18th &amp; Victoria) and feed birds or have a “birdy” yard we’d love you to join us as a “feeder watcher” counting birds on Sunday December 20th, as part of the 40th Annual Brandon Christmas Bird Count. This is part of a North America wide effort to do a census of birds around Christmas.</p>
<p>It’s easy, all you do is sign-up, then check your birds during the day, for as long as you like. Then let us know where you are, what you see, and how long you looked. Just record the maximum number of each species you see at any one time, to avoid overcounting. If you aren’t sure what bird you are seeing, just contact us and we’ll help you out.</p>

<p>The cold, turbulent seas of the Southern Ocean support some of the most diverse seabird communities on the planet. Dr.&nbsp;Michael Schrimpf will talk about his experiences traveling to Antarctica to study the penguins, petrels, shags, and other birds that call this harsh environment home. He will discuss how he and his colleagues collect data on breeding distributions, why we find different species where we do, and the similarities and differences to the ecology of our local birds. Ever think of traveling to the Antarctic? Learn how doing so can aid in research on Southern Ocean birds. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScp7Ja4_2Kv2ml4nkAxSCgrAeRkuesBB4jxc8fQFwTO1vAxXg/viewform">Sign up via this form</a>!</p>

<p><span class="event-title">Cultural Evolution in Bird Song</span> Hosted by Westman Naturalists</p>
<p>While many groups of birds instinctively ‘know’ and can produce their normal adult vocalizations without training, Passerines are one of the few groups in which juveniles must learn their species-specific song from an adult tutor. This reliance on song learning results in both the development of regional dialects, but also the potential for songs to evolve and change over time within populations. We will discuss the potential of this in relation to our recent work looking at continent-wide shifts in songs among white-throated sparrows.</p>

<p>Join the Nature Conservancy of Canada, Important Bird Areas Manitoba, and Westman Naturalists to learn about Shorebird Conservation in Manitoba.</p>
<p>Shorebirds are a diverse group of migratory birds, a few species of which have some of the longest migration distances in the feathered world. This group of birds is strongly associated with shallow water habitats, such as those found on beaches or shorelines of lakes, shallow wetlands and in flooded fields or grasslands, where they forage for food in the mud and sand. Many follow the “Central Flyway” migratory route that passes through the Prairies.</p>
<p>Learn how International Shorebird Survey volunteers count large flocks of shorebirds, and listen to migratory stories that were tracked through the Motus Wildlife Tracking System!</p>

<p>This <a href="https://www.canadahelps.org/en/charities/bird-studies-canada/p2p/birdathon20/">Birdathon</a> is a major fund-raising event for Bird Studies Canada, and a chance to get out for some serious birding - whilst keeping safe of course. Two local groups have had a traditional friendly rivalry, both involve Westman Naturalists.</p>
<p>The “Ageing Turkeys’ will be birding in May, if you are interested in joining or learning more about this group please contact Buzz Crowston at <a href="mailto:vcrowsto@mts.net">vcrowsto@mts.net</a>.</p>
<p>COVID-19 can’t stop Erica and the “Westman Willets”, the Birdathon must go on! This year, our team of enthusiastic birders is once again participating in the Great Canadian Birdathon, raising money in support of avian research and conservation in Canada. Traditionally we would all pile into a car and embark on a grand adventure, travelling all over south western Manitoba, finding as many bird species as possible within a 24 hour period. It is what we birders call a “big day”.</p>
<p>However with the current conditions surrounding COVID-19, our plans have had to change. In 2020, we will hold a different kind of big day, one where we all bird together, while being miles apart. On May 23 we will each bird in our own backyards, and at the end of the day we will come together, virtually, and share our lists. It’ll take some good luck and good birding to beat our travelling total of 130 species, but we’ll give it our best shot!</p>
<p>We hope this years birdathon will remind others that there is nature to be found, and enjoyed, in our own backyards.</p>

<p><span class="event-title">Whitewater Lake</span> Hosted by Westman Naturalists</p>
<p>We will explore one of the best birding areas in the province, Whitewater IBA (Importan Bird Area), visiting several good birding spots around the lake. This is not a “Blitz” but we should see impressive numbers of ducks, geese and swans; plus other species.</p>
<p>Birding at Whitewater involves a fair amount of driving on dirt roads. There will probably also be a little (optional) walking.</p>
<p>Please bring:</p>
<ul>
<li>Warm clothes</li>
<li>Suitable footwear (it may be wet)</li>
<li>Binoculars. camera and telescope if you have them</li>
<li>Lunch &amp; snacks, plus coffee if you need it</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Car-pooling</strong> We will meet at the SE corner of the Landmark Cinema parking lot at 8:00am (10 minutes before sunrise) to arrive at Whitewater at about 9:00am. We plan to be finished around 2pm, to return to Brandon by about 3pm.</p>
<p><strong>Please email us</strong> if you’d like to attend, with whether you are travelling independently or will meet us in Brandon, and your cell number – so we can contact you if we have to cancel.</p>
<p><strong>Time</strong>: 8:00 AM<br><strong>Location</strong>: Westman Region</p>

<p><span class="event-title">Delta Marsh &amp; Portage Plains. N of Portage</span> Hosted by Westman Naturalists</p>
<p>Cal Cuthbert will guide us to find all that this great area north of Portage offers. Should be an excellent outing as Cal is an expert birder and guide and knows the area very well.</p>
<p>To car-pool, we will meet at 7:30am in Brandon, <strong>please email the Westman Naturalists to confirm your attendance</strong> and get details regarding the car-pooling location.</p>
<p>On site, we will all meet at about 9:00am at Up The Creek Acres located 8 miles N of Portage on #240 then 2 miles E on #227. After crossing Portage Creek (which is well marked) take the first right (a road that goes south through a wooded area) for about 100m.</p>
<p>We will start with a walkabout on Cal’s property. He has a number of trails both in open “grassland” and riparian areas. His place is also a good place for washroom/coffee break before working our way to the Delta beach ridge. We’ll have a chance at both shorebirds and warblers/sparrows with an assortment of other birds as well.</p>
<p>Cal reminds everyone to bring lots of coffee and huge lunches; together with binoculars, camera and telescope if you have them; and clothing and shoes appropriate for the weather.</p>
<p><strong>Please email us</strong> if you’d like to attend, with whether you are traveling independently or will meet us in Brandon, and your cell number – so we can contact you if we have to cancel.</p>

<p><span class="event-title">Tallgrass Prairie in Westman?</span> Hosted by Westman Naturalists</p>
<p>The Westman Naturalists are pleased to offer a field trip to the Manitoba Habitat Heritage Corporation property at Noble Lake, morning of Saturday August 10. This wonderful biologically diverse property is a 45 min drive from Brandon. It stretches along the west side of Noble Lake, and offers grasslands, deciduous forests and shrubby areas to explore. Grassland plant expert, Mae Elsinger, will be on hand to teach us how to identify grasses.</p>
<p>This field trip offers a great opportunity for birding and botanizing. And, anyone interested in canoeing or kayaking on the lake may do so. There are cottages on the east side of the lake, and motor boats are strictly prohibited.</p>
<p>If you wish extend your outing past the morning trip, you can stay on the property or explore other local areas such as the Souris River Bend Wildlife Management Area to the west of the lake.</p>
<p>Participants who wish to car pool from Brandon will leave at <strong>8:00 am</strong>, to get to the site between 8:45 and 9:00 am. We will have some spaces for those who prefer not to drive. We will email directions for those who want to travel directly to the site… please register ahead of time.</p>
<p>Naturalists of all skill levels are welcome. There are mowed trails throughout much of the property. However, we may be heading off those trails. Please wear appropriate footwear. Also, poison ivy is widespread, and, yes, there are still a few ticks around. Please plan to bring:</p>
<ul>
<li>Binoculars / camera</li>
<li>Bird book or app</li>
<li>Suitable clothing and footwear</li>
<li>Water, and a lunch.</li>
<li>Insect repellent, sunscreen and a hat.</li>
<li>A walking stick, if need be, however, there terrain is fairly level.</li>
</ul>
<p>To help with our planning, please email the Westman Naturalists to let us know if you plan to attend this outing, together with whether you plan to join us in Brandon or at the site itself.</p>
