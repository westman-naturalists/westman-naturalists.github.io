Westman Naturalists Inc. membership is open to everyone who is interested in nature and the environment, and who support the club objectives. The objectives are to offer nature-related educational opportunities, encourage study and protection of the natural world, collect nature-related data for statistical and educational purposes, and act as environmental stewards.

Please note that membership is **NOT REQUIRED** to participate in outings or presentations, or to receive WN newsletters.

Your membership will support the activities of Westman Naturalists Inc. and allow you to have direct input into the programs and activities of the club. You will be able to serve to be a member of the board, or one of our sub-committees and vote at Annual General Meetings (see [Bylaws](bylaws.html) for more details).

There are three categories of membership: 

**Individual**  
Persons eighteen years or older who pay annual dues are eligible to vote, serve on a committee, and hold office.

**Youth**  
All youth under the age of eighteen years need parental or guardian consent to obtain membership or join a committee. Youth sixteen years of age or older may obtain individual membership, pay annual fees, serve on a committee and can vote at a General Meeting. Youth younger than sixteen years can serve on a committee without being a paying Member and are not entitled to vote.

**Honorary Life**  
Persons may be named honorary life Members by the Board in recognition of outstanding service or significant in-kind or financial contributions to the Club. They are not required to pay membership dues and are entitled to vote and hold office.
